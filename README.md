This is my Takov flea market bot.
I was banned because one account was running two bots at the same time, but it was not banned by HWID.
Until the ban, the bot worked well. I guess that only excessive access will lead to the ban, but at the same time, the bot will cause the transaction amount between you and the doctor to be too large, which may pose a risk to the account.

I can make about 5-8 million rubles a day with this bot.

The "PHPSESSID" needed in the script can be obtained in the startup parameters of "EscapeFromTarkov_BE.exe" when the client starts, but it needs to end the game process immediately, because once the game starts successfully, it will try to replace the PHPSESSID.

have fun.
